    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial Instinct is a technology-focused initiative centered on building
      intelligent and secure systems that solve real problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      We emphasize clarity over complexity, resilience over novelty, and thoughtful
      engineering over shortcuts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work blends artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software
      engineering into systems that are designed to be trusted and maintained.
